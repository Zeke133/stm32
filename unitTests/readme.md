# Sources of unit-tests.

**GoogleTest** framework is used and needed for tests build.
Repository with googleTest can be cloned from **GitHub** and must be placed in same directory with this project.

    ... projectsDir / ${projectRoot} / ...
                    / googleTest / ...
                    / stm32flash / ...

Unit-testing can't cover whole project, but all hardware independent modules must be covered.
