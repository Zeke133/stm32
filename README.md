# stm32 
Here project of light object oriented framework for STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill widely used developement board.
A main cause of it's developement is to create platform for classic motorcycle board computer or any other light automation.

It based on STM Std Peripherial Driver and CMSIS and creates user friendly API on C++ to use it.
Aim is to make quick and easy use of any peripherial devices like objects and to create in such way some next layer objects for work with different devices like DS18B20 and so on.

Project needs just a GCC C++ compiller (arm-none-eabi-g++D:\Projects\stm32\) to build and no need in any other IDE or tools to run.
On 1st step build was made using Visual Studio Code tasks.
On 2nd step build using CMake and make utilities.
